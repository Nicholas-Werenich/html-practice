        The form tag is used to create a containere where all the inputs for a form must be put inside.
        The attributes that ae required are the name, id, and method.

        name gives some descriptive information about what the form will be used for.

        id allows us to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our code.

        method has two typical values: get and post. Get is used for forms that do
        not ask for personal information (search bars, etc.). Post is used for forms
        that ask for personal information (login and signup pages, etc.).

        This is a text input. type = "text", name and id are all required attributes.
        The required attribute is only necessary when you want to make sure the user 
        has to fill in the input before submitting the form.
    
        The type attrubute defines the type of input.
        The name attribute defines the variable name that would be used for the input when the datat gets passed to the server
        (requires back-end scripting, which is beyond the scope of this course).
        The id attribute allows us to reference the input from the label and from other parts of out code.

        All inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the input using the inpus id attribute.
        When an input is required, it is important to incloude the word required in the labels text.

        This is a radio button input, which are good when you want the user to select one option from a list of options.

        name and id and value are required attributes. The value should represent the choice the user has selected.
        Note, most importantly, the name attribute for each related radio button should be exactly the same.

        This is also an input where the label typically shows up after the input.
