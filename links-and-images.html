    Paragraphs are an example of block elements because, by default they take
    up the eintire width of the web page and add space at the top and bottom of the element.

    <!--Anchors are an example of inline elements becuase, by default, they only take up the space that they need to.
    We showed the difference between block and inline lements sing Developer Tool, which we accessed using Ctrl+Shift+I.

    <!-- This is an example of an image tag.
The src attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
The src attrubite can be an internet location (i.e, https://www.google.com/...),
But the best practice is to have your own images folder that stores all the images you use on your website.

Note: img is a self-closing tag.-->
